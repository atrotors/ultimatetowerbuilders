<p>The article written in 2014 by Lauren Stewart, explores the freedom that DMCA has granted copyright holders to implement anticircumvention protection on their software beyond what it was originally intended. It uses the MDY v. Blizzard case as a case study for this kind of abuse. Moreover copyright holders are hindering new legislation about DMCA by lobbying against it.</p>

An exploratory survey of music piracy and acquisition behaviour</a></h4>

<p>Written by Storm Gloor and Clyde Philip Rolston, this 2010 article looks at digital piracy in the music industry and more specifically, why people pirate music and how it effects the industry. This is a good article as it presents some interesting ideas regarding the philosophy behind piracy, focusing more on why people do it, and suggests possible solutions/outcomes based on adapting to how people think instead of punishing them. The findings are based off a survey that asks &ldquo;why non-payers acquired tracks without paying&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tracks downloaded per month&rdquo;, and suggested pricing for music, among other things. The survey results are included in the article and provide information from several demographics. The article was part of the annual peer reviewed MEIEA (music and entertainment industry educators association) journal, which is made up of educators and academics in the music and entertainment industry.</p>

<p><strong>Software Piracy in Research: A Moral Analysis</strong> was an article written by Gary Santillanes and Ryan Marshall Felder and published in August 2015 to ‘Science and Engineering Ethics’ issue 21.4 page 967-977, a journal discussing ethical issues faced by modern scientists and engineers. This article discusses the need that modern researchers have for advanced software to conduct concise and effective research and addresses the fact that not all researchers can afford the software they need. Many researchers who believe their work enhance the quality of human life are often found in an ethical dilemma deciding if they should break the law and pirate software that they could otherwise not afford or simply restrict their research to what can be completed with the free software that is available. This article argues that many scientists moral code drives them to seriously consider the illegal piracy of such software in order continue their pursuit in valuable research.</p>
