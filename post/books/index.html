<p>The book titled ‘Steal this computer book 4.0 – What They Won’t Tell You About The Internet’, written by Wallace Wange is published No Strach Press. This resource is about exposing the truth about the internet and what the average consumer doesn’t know. It explains what hackers do, how they do it, and how you can protect yourself. This book contains one particular chapter, where it goes through the different measures taken to stop hackers copying and pirating software. This chapter begins by talking about how when people first started selling computer programs on tape, others discovered that they could easily copy and share the program.
Explains origins, Explains the use of a dongle that plugs into the computer&rsquo;s parallel port, and if the dongle wasn’t plugged in the program wouldn’t work. Then further explains that hackers were able to emulate the dongles, so the dongle was no longer needed to run the software. Explains how not technique so far has been able to stop these pirates. The use of bittorrent to share files between computers, also use usenet. Upload software anonymously. Finally explains how the motion picture association of America (MPAA) tried to stop piracy, where their techniques have had varying degrees of success. Nowadays, for the average user pirating software has become too hard, and not convenient. It’s the dedicated software pirates are the ones pirating software these days. Finding a pirated program is tedious, more frustrating than going out and buying the software.</p>

<p>Written by Piotr Stryszowski and Danny Scorpecci, This book was published on the 7th of July 2009 and was done as part of a project by OECD; a multinational organisation that focuses on economics and world trade, in order to give a greater understanding of digital piracy and raise awareness of the effects caused by intellectual property infringements. There are only 134 pages with 3 main chapters, a case study and 3 annexes, so it is fairly
easy to read through and provides a good insight and overview of the issue of digital piracy. The first chapter looks at the different markets and industries that piracy effects (such as music, movies, software, books, etc.) and looks at how and why these industries suffer from piracy by looking at their economic properties. Chapter 2 looks at piracy as its own market, exploring factors like the supply/demand of digital piracy and what drives it. The third chapter
discusses the actions industries have taken to try and combat digital piracy and the final chapter (case study), looks at the sports sector and how broadcasting, streaming, and dvd releases are effected by piracy.</p>

<p><strong>Software Piracy Exposed</strong> is a book written by Paul Craig, Ron Honick and Mark Burnett and published in 2005. This book discusses the reality of software piracy and the serious repercussions that are caused by both private and corporate software piracy that takes place. From the birth of software piracy in the 1980’s this book goes into detail describing the evolution of how software is pirated and the reality that these pirates have damaged the software industry. The process undertaken by pirates is reviewed in this
book, beginning with getting access to the software, cracking any copy protection technology that has been used to protect against piracy and then distributing the software (usually over the internet through complex distribution chains). The authors emphasize that these pirates partaking in organized crime and are incredibly skilled at what they do. As it currently stands the authors suggest that piracy cannot simply be stopped, these are incredible smart people who find great pleasure in
cracking these “undefeatable” software locks. In conclusion the authors suggest that the only hope to stop piracy is in the evolution of “copy protection technology’s” that cannot be broken by pirates.</p>
